# aboutMe-1
I have created an About Me webpage that is mobile responsive using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

I created the page using the following files: index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html and style.css.

I used the following Bootstrap items:

navbar

cards

containers/rows/columns

a responsive layout

responsive images

form groups

links

Here is a link to the page I created:
